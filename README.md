# Heart_Prediction_Failure
The aim of this project is to develop a machine-learning model to predict the chance of a person being diagnosed with heart failure within the following year. The model will be trained on a dataset of medical records and evaluated on its ability to accurately predict heart failure diagnosis, as well as identify risk factors for heart failure.
It is a medical problem that deals with the prediction of heart failure using machine learning algorithms.


1. Exploratory Data Analysis:

Exploratory data analysis on different features of dataset and also understand relationship between different variables with target variable.

2. Preprocess the data:

The data should be preprocessed to remove any missing values, outliers, etc.

3. Train the model:

Various machine-learning algorithms can be used to train the model such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

4. Evaluate the model:

The performance of the model should be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
