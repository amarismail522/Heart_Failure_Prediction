# Heart_Prediction_Failure
The aim of this project is to develop a machine-learning model to predict the chance of a person being diagnosed with heart failure within the following year. The model will be trained on a dataset of medical records and evaluated on its ability to accurately predict heart failure diagnosis, as well as identify risk factors for heart failure.
